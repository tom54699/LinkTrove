## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update `computeGhostIndex` in `src/app/webpages/CardGrid.tsx` to use `centerX` for hysteresis checks.
- [x] 1.2 Verify drag-and-drop behavior feels smoother (manual testing).
- [x] 1.3 Ensure no regressions in "flapping" (rapid switching) when holding still near the boundary.
